# Movie Data Analysis Using Python - Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Welcome to the repository for my Movies Data Analysis whilst using Python project. In this project, I analysed thousands of rows of movie data using a variety of different libraries in python such as Pandas to convert the csv file I was working with to a dataframes. Matplotlib to use visualisations for my graphs and Seaborn to further enhance my capabilities with visualising my data. The Python queries provided in this repository is me exploring the different aspects of the movies' data, to find out key insights such as the longest movie, the most expensive movie and the most profitable movie along with other insights.

## Introduction

The CSV file that I worked with contained thousands of rows of data with 20 columns of data, some of which were in a non-usable format meaning it was my job to convert the data types in a format in which I could effectively query them.
One of my tasks whilst querying the data was to make a comaprison between two movies of my choosing and explain the differences between them. I was also tasked with creating a minimum of three visualisations showing my insights from the dataset.
The code that I wrote was written in Google Colab with the use of markdown to document my insights from the data.

## Python Queries

The Python queries in this repository cover a wide range of analyses, including:

* Analysing the datatypes
* Analysing the dataset's columns
* Converting datatypes from dictionaries into list
* Removing null rows and dropping columns with no use
* Finding the movie with the highest revenue
* Identifying the movie with the longest runtime
* Investigating which movie has the highest popularity
* Finding the movie with the highest budget
* Looking at the movie with the highest profit
* Finding the movie with the highest average votes
* Identifying the movie with the highest number of votes
* Making a comparison of two rows of data - using Markdown to document findings
* Looking at the correlations between the numerical columns in the dataset
* Visualising the correlations with a heatmap
* Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to create several graphs highlighting my findings

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/AmritBinning/Movie_Analysis_with_Python/blob/main/Movie_python_project.ipynb

Connect to your database management system (e.g. Dataspell, Google Colab, Jupiter Notebook).

Run the Python queries provided in your database environment.

Review the results of each query to gain insights from the movies dataset.
